## 📌 Project Description  
This project processes **MoMo SMS transaction data** in XML format, cleans and categorizes it, stores it in a relational database, and provides a **web-based dashboard** to analyze and visualize transaction insights.

## 🏛️ System Architecture  
We use an **ETL pipeline** to extract, transform, and load data into a database. The cleaned data is then used to generate analytics and visualizations on a simple dashboard.
